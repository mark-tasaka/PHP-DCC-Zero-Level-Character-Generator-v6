# PHP-DCC-Zero-Level-Character-Generator-v6
The sixth iteration of the Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) Zero-Level Character Generator, which allows DCC Players and Judge to randomly generator four zero-level characters for their DCC games. The generator includes several options for customizing the randomly generated characters, which includes name generators, options of modifying the die rolls, and providing character's with maximum hit points. This iteration of the Zero-Level Character Generator builds on the DCC Greenleaf Adventures Zero-Level Character Generator (https://github.com/mark-tasaka/PHP-Greenleaf-Adventures-DCC-Zero-Level-Character-Generator).
